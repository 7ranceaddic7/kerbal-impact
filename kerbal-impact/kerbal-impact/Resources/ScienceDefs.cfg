	{
		default = Analysed seismic data.
		Mun = Seismic data reveals a smaller than expected metal core.
		Minmus = The data seems to be suggesting that Minmus has a core of chocolate chips.
		Moho = Moho appears to be hollow! Perhaps there is a way in somewhere?
		Gilly = You need to use some velcro to stop the probe being bounced of the surface. Gilly seems to be mostly gravel around a tiny core.
		Dres = It's a rock.
		Ike = The seismic waves have been completely muffled by Ike.
		Tylo = Tylo is a solid shell of ice around a rocky core.
		Vall = Vall has slushy oceans under a thick blanket of ice.
		Bop = The impact was followed by a series of vibrations like something rolling over in its sleep.
		Pol = Bless you!
		Eeloo = Wwloo is a layer of ice around a rocky core. You could have guessed that from looking.
